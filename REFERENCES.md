# References for Microbiome-Immunotherapy-Analysis

This repository's sample data and concepts are inspired by scientific studies on the gut microbiome's role in cancer immunotherapy response. Below is a list of key references from peer-reviewed articles and public databases. The sample data in `data/microbiome_data.csv` simulates relative abundances of taxa commonly associated with responders (e.g., higher levels of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Akkermansia muciniphila) versus non-responders, based on findings from these sources.
